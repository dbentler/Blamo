# Blamo Game Engine

Sometimes, working as a developer, you just get that "I want to make something for fun" itch that can not be ignored.

So I decided I will fulfil that itch but working on a game engine called "Blamo", a reference to the Halo series' old [Blam](https://www.halopedia.org/Blam_engine) engine.

Not only that, but I'm going to write it solely using C just to feel something.

This will be an on and off project that I'll be working on for fun, as I am currently employed as a full time developer.

# Engine specifics:

Will update this later...

# How to run:

## Windows:

1. Execute `make` (you can install Make via chocolately)
2. You'll have the .exe file that you can execute.

## macOS and/or Linux

Haven't tested it yet.
